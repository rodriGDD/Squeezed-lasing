# Generation of squeezed lasing in cavity QED systems
We explore a novel source of non-classical light called squeezed laser, which combines desirable features, like narrow linewidth or long coherence times, typical from standard lasers, with characteristic properties of squeezed states, such as non-trivial photon correlations and reduced quadrature fluctuations. In particular, we analyse and compare two possible implementations of the squeezed laser, one based on parametric driving of an optical cavity, and another relying on cavity assisted Raman transitions in a four-level system. We prove that both models present a lasing phase transition, existing a stimulated emission regime in which squeezing effects appear when perturbating the system with an external field. The further development of such a versatile and innovative source of light would have potential applications in interferometry, spectroscopy, or quantum metrology.
